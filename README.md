# Data-Analytics-Project
This project showcases SQL skills and Data visualization

Hi my name is Faisa welcome to my Github page!
My first project is a Data analytics project where I explored a data set from the WHO based on the health of 196 countries across the world.
In this project I used programs and tools such as Excel, Power BI and My SQL work bench.
I analysed the data in excel and in the language SQL to extract interesting information, which I presented my insight on a dashboard as part of a presentation to my peers and potential employers.
Thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoy.
